[the following newspaper clipping is attached with “1924” noted on it] 

THIS MAY VERY COLD 

Not extra wet, however, weatherman’s report declares. 

 “The month of May,” frankly remarks David Cuthbertson, federal meteorologist, “in Buffalo was as a 

whole very cold.” 

 However, he cheerfully reminds us that May, 1917, was colder. Less rain than usual fell last month, he adds, 
destroying the popular illusion of wetness. The idea that the Pan-American May was just a month as May, 1924, 
also is not borne out. His report follows: 

 The climatological data compiled from the records of the local weather bureau office gives the month of May, 1924, a mean 
temperature of 48.3 degrees, being the coldest May in 53 years, with the exception of 1917, when the mean was 47.0 degrees. A 
mean temperature of 48 also occurred in 1907. On but four days during the month was the mean temperature in excess of the 
normal, the total deficiency in temperature for the month being 191 degrees. The mean maximum temperature was 54.7 degrees; 
mean minimum, 41.9 degrees. The highest temperature was 73 degrees on the seventh; lowest, 32 degrees, on the second; 
monthly range, 41 degrees; mean daily range, 12.8 degrees. 

 The total precipitation was 2.59 inches, being 0.51 inch below the normal. Precipitation of .01 or more occurred on sixteen 
days, and on seven other days was recorded. Snow fell on the second, the amount being 0.3 inch. 

 The total wind movement was 14,359 miles, giving an average hourly velocity of 19.3 miles. The maximum wind velocity 
was 56 miles, from the Southwest on the fourth. The prevailing wind direction was southwest. 

Mean relative humidity at 8 a. m., 83 per cent; noon, 80 per cent.; 8 p.m., 75 percent. 

 There were four clear days during the month, sixteen partly cloudy and eleven cloudy.

Notes, newspaper clippings in the back of the diary: 

 

 

“SCHIEBER – In this city, Jan. 5, Annie Schieber, aged 21 years. Funeral Sunday from residence, 866 Seneca 
street, at 2 P.M., and from St. Stephen’s Church, corner Peckham and Adams streets, at 2:30. Friends and 
acquaintances invited to attend.” [“1887” written on clipping] 

 

 “One of the pleasantest and happiest social events of the season was the celebration of the golden wedding of Mr. 
and Mrs. C. A. Bloomer in the parlors of the Delaware avenue M.F. Church last Tuesday evening. The parlors were 
beautifully decorated. At one end of the large parlor was a canopy of smilax, beneath which hung a large bell of 
autumn leaves and white carnations. In front of the canopy was suspended the figures 1839-1889 in white roses and 
carnations. A beautiful feature of the decorations was a monogram containing the letters B and F, Mrs. Bloomer’s 
maiden name having been Frear, in white rosebuds and carnations. 

 Mrs. Bloomer wore a Directoire gown of golden brown armure silk, with a heavy brocaded satin front. The 
remembrances were numerous and beautiful. Among the gifts was $500 in gold from the Western Elevating Comp 
any with which Mr. Bloomere is connected. Nearly 500 relatives and friends congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Bloomer. 
Among those present from abroad were the Rev. J.W. Bashford, the Hon. D.C. Bloomer and Mrs. Bloomer of 
Council Bluffs, Ia, Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Bloomer of Lodi, Mrs. D. A. Phillips of New York, Mrs. E. Keller of Albion, 
Mich., Prof. and Mrs. W. R. Prentice of Hornellsville, and Miss H. Nellie Martin of Auburn.”

“COPPER ROOFS 

PITCH: - Pitch or Roofs to be covered with flat seam copper roofing should not be less than ½. nor more than 3. to 
the foot. 

Pitch of ribbed and standing seam roofs should not be less than 2. and preferably 4 to 5. to the foot. 

FINISH: Copper will develop verdigris in a few months due to natural phenomena. When it is desired to obtain a 
verdigris finish immediately it can be done by the use of one of the following methods; 

(a) Dissolve 10 parts copper in 2 ½ parts of strong nitric acid and then add 150 parts of 20% acetic acid and 5 
parts of ammonia chloride. The resulting solution shall be diluted with about 3 parts water and applied to 
surface with a brush and allowed to dry. Sufficient applications at one or two day intervals shall be made 
until desired effect is produced. 
(b) Apply the following solution: 1 lb of powdered sal ammoniac to 5 gals of water; dissolve thoroughly and let 
stand 24 hrs. Apply to copper with a brush, covering every part. Let stand one day and then sprinkle surface 
with clean water. 
(c) Use a solution of ½ lb of salt to 2 gals of water. Apply in same manner. 


 

If a dark copper finish is desired it can be obtained by the following method: Rub off the copper with cotton 
waste soaked in boiled linseed oil. Touch up soldered seams with copper bronze. 


Before applying coloring solution: Clean with a strong solution (4 to 6 oz pergallon) of soda in hot water. Wash 
this off with clean hot water.”
